<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center; "> CAUSES OF Pollution</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;line-height: 30px;margin-bottom: 30px; ">What Are The Causes Of Environmental Pollution? | by Prkruti ...Pollution, in its various forms, arises from a multitude of human activities and natural occurrences. Key drivers include the burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, industrial emissions, agricultural practices, and improper waste disposal. These activities release harmful substances into the air, water, and land, causing diverse forms of pollution. 
Here's a breakdown of the main causes:
<ol style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;line-height: 30px;margin-bottom: 30px; type="1">
 <li>Air Pollution:
Burning fossil fuels:
Coal, oil, and natural gas release pollutants like carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter when burned for energy and transportation. 
<li>
Industrial emissions:
Factories and power plants release various pollutants, including carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and heavy metals. 
<li>
Vehicular exhaust:
Cars, trucks, and other vehicles emit pollutants like nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. 
<li>
Agricultural practices:
Agricultural activities, including the use of fertilizers and pesticides, can release harmful chemicals into the air. 
<li>
Deforestation:
The clearing of forests reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere, contributing to increased levels of greenhouse gases.
<LI> 
Water Pollution:
Industrial discharge:
Factories often release wastewater containing pollutants like heavy metals, chemicals, and organic matter into rivers and oceans. 
<li>
Agricultural runoff:
Rainwater washes fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste from farms into water bodies, polluting them. 
<li>
Sewage and wastewater:
Untreated or improperly treated sewage can contaminate water sources with pathogens and harmful chemicals.
<li> 
Oil spills:
Accidental or deliberate spills of oil at sea can severely damage marine ecosystems. 
<li>
Marine dumping:
Improper disposal of waste at sea can lead to pollution of coastal areas and the open ocean. 
<li>
Land Pollution:
Improper waste disposal:
Landfills, open dumps, and improper disposal of solid waste contribute to soil and groundwater pollution.
<li> 
Industrial waste:
Mining activities, chemical manufacturing, and other industries generate waste that can contaminate soil and groundwater.
<LI> 
Agricultural practices:
Excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides can contaminate soil and affect soil health. 
<li>
Construction and demolition:
Construction and demolition activities generate debris and dust that can pollute the land. 
<li>
Other Forms of Pollution:

<LI>
Noise pollution:
Excessive noise from traffic, construction, industrial activities, and other sources can cause stress, hearing damage, and other health problems. 
<LI>
Light pollution:
Excessive artificial light at night can disrupt ecosystems, affect human health, and interfere with astronomical observations. 
<LI>
Thermal pollution:
Discharge of heated water from industrial processes into water bodies can harm aquatic life. 
While human activities are the primary drivers of pollution, natural events like volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and natural decay of organic matter can also contribute to pollution</UL> <p>
